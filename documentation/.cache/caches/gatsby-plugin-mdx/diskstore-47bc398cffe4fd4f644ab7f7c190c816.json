In this way, the market maker is trying to catch price spikes in the direction of the trend and buy additional inventory only in the event of larger moves, but sell more quickly when there is an opportunity to minimize the duration of the inventory is held. This approach also has a mean reversion bias, i.e. buy only when there is a larger move downwards, in the hopes of stabilization or recovery after such a large move.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Market making in volatile or trending markets is more advanced and risky for new traders.
