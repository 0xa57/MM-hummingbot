# `perpetual_market_making`

## 📁 [Strategy folder](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/strategy/perpetual_market_making)

## 📝 Summary

Perpetual market making allows Hummingbot users to market make on supported derivatives exchanges. The strategy has position management features to make managing positions easier and remove the need to interact with the derivative exchange manually.

Like pure market making strategy, it keeps placing limit buy and sell orders on the order book and waits for other participants (takers) to fill its orders.
